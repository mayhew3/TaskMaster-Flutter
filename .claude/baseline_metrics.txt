# Baseline Metrics - Before Testing Phase
Date: 2025-10-13

## Test Status
- Total tests: 101
- Passing: 101
- Failing: 0
- Test execution time: ~6 seconds

## Test Breakdown
- Unit tests (RecurrenceHelper, models, helpers): ~60 tests
- Widget tests (EditableTaskField, EditableTaskItem): ~40 tests
- Integration tests: 0 ❌
- Screen tests (major screens): 0 ❌
- Redux layer tests: 0 ❌

## Critical Gaps Identified
❌ Zero integration tests - biggest risk!
❌ No tests for Add/Edit screen (most complex UI)
❌ No tests for Task List screen (main UI)
❌ No tests for Sprint Planning screens
❌ No tests for authentication flow
❌ No tests for data loading

## Coverage Estimate
~30% (mostly unit tests, missing integration and screen tests)

## Next Steps
Write critical path integration tests:
1. Task CRUD flow
2. Recurring task completion
3. Sprint creation
4. Authentication flow
5. Snooze functionality
